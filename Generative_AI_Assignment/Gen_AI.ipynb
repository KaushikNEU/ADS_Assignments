    "Modern generative modeling contains several important families. Here we briefly introduce four of the most influential ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Train two neural networks in a **minimax game**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Generator (G)** takes random noise and tries to produce realistic samples (e.g., images).\n",
    "- A **Discriminator (D)** tries to distinguish between real samples from the dataset and fake samples from the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time:\n",
    "- The generator improves at fooling the discriminator.\n",
    "- The discriminator improves at telling real from fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- Image synthesis (e.g., faces, scenes).\n",
    "- Image-to-image translation (e.g., sketches → photos).\n",
    "- Style transfer and super-resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- Training instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Mode collapse (generator produces limited variety).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Learn a **latent variable model** that encodes data into a continuous latent space and decodes back to the original domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder**: Maps input data (e.g., images) to a distribution over latent variables (mean and variance).\n",
    "- **Decoder**: Samples from the latent distribution and reconstructs the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective combines:\n",
    "- **Reconstruction loss** (how well the input is reconstructed).\n",
    "- **KL-divergence** regularization (how close the latent distribution is to a prior, usually a standard Gaussian).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- Generating smooth variations of images.\n",
    "- Latent space interpolation.\n",
    "- Anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- Blurry reconstructions for images.\n",
    "- Balance between reconstruction quality and latent regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Learn to **reverse a diffusion (noising) process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward process: Gradually add noise to data over many steps, eventually reaching pure noise.\n",
    "- Reverse process: Train a neural network to **remove noise step-by-step**, reconstructing the original data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, generation starts from pure noise and iteratively denoises to produce realistic samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- High-fidelity image generation.\n",
    "- Text-to-image models (e.g., prompt → image).\n",
    "- Audio and video synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Excellent image quality.\n",
    "- More stable training compared to GANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.4 Transformer-based Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** Use **self-attention** to model dependencies between tokens (words, subwords, characters) in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokens are embedded into vectors.\n",
    "- Multiple **self-attention layers** allow each token to attend to others.\n",
    "- Output is a distribution over the next token, given previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder-only Transformers** (like GPT-2) are trained with a simple objective:\n",

    "2. Predicts the next token.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Architecture Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the generative models mentioned vary in structure, Transformer-based language models share a few critical architectural components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization and Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Raw text is split into tokens (words, subwords, or characters).\n",
    "   - Each token is mapped to a dense **embedding vector**.\n",
    "   - Positional encodings are added to embeddings to represent the token's position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "   - Each layer computes **queries (Q)**, **keys (K)**, and **values (V)** from the embeddings.\n",
    "   - Attention weights are computed as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Masked self-attention** is used in decoder-only models so a token cannot attend to future tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Attention**\n",
    "   - Multiple attention “heads” learn different types of relationships in parallel.\n",
    "   - Outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feedforward Networks**\n",
    "   - After attention, each position passes through a small **fully connected network** (typically two linear layers with a non-linearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**\n",
    "   - Residual skips and normalization provide stable training.\n",
    "   - Output of each sub-layer is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{SubLayer}(x))\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Projection and Softmax**\n",
    "   - Final hidden states are projected to vocabulary size.\n",
    "   - A softmax over the vocabulary yields a **probability distribution over next tokens**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components, stacked many times, produce a powerful sequence model that can approximate complex language distributions.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Given a sequence of tokens \\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_T \\),\n",
    "- The model learns to maximize:\n",

    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented as **next-token prediction** using a cross-entropy loss over the vocabulary at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect a large corpus of text.\n",
    "2. Tokenize into subword units.\n",
    "3. Form sequences of fixed length (e.g., 512 tokens).\n",
    "4. Train with mini-batch gradient descent, often on GPUs/TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality and Bias**\n",
    "  - Model reflects patterns and biases from its training data.\n",
    "  - May generate toxic, biased, or incorrect content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposure Bias**\n",
    "  - At training time, the model always sees ground-truth previous tokens.\n",
    "  - At generation time, it conditions on its own (possibly mistaken) outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hallucinations**\n",
    "  - Model may generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect statements.\n",
    "  - Important for safety-critical or factual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute and Energy Cost**\n",
    "  - Large models require significant compute and energy to train.\n",
    "  - Deployment also requires optimization for latency and cost.\n",

    "   - BLEU: precision-based; common in translation.\n",
    "   - ROUGE: recall-oriented; common in summarization.\n",

    "\n",
    "While GPT-2 and similar models can generate impressive and coherent text, it is important to acknowledge their limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They do **not understand** language in a human sense; they model statistical patterns.\n",
    "- They can generate **biased, offensive, or factually incorrect** content.\n",
    "- They may output **hallucinations**—confidently stated but false information.\n",
    "- They should be used with **human oversight**, particularly in sensitive domains\n",
    "  (e.g., healthcare, legal, financial advice).\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world systems, text generation is often combined with:\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored both the **theoretical foundations** and a **practical implementation** of generative AI, with a focus on Transformer-based language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We surveyed major classes of generative models:\n",
    "  - **GANs** for adversarial training and image synthesis.\n",
    "  - **VAEs** for continuous latent variable modeling.\n",
    "  - **Diffusion models** for iterative denoising and high-fidelity images.\n",
    "  - **Transformers** for sequence modeling and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We examined core **architecture principles** of Transformer language models:\n",
    "  - Tokenization, embeddings, self-attention, feedforward layers, and output projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We discussed **training methodologies and challenges**, including:\n",
    "  - Maximum likelihood training, exposure bias, and hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reviewed key **evaluation metrics**, such as perplexity, BLEU/ROUGE, FID, and human evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We implemented hands-on examples with **GPT-2** to:\n",
    "  - Generate text from prompts.\n",
    "  - Analyze the effects of **temperature**, **top-k**, and **top-p**.\n",
    "  - Visualize **next-token probabilities** to understand model uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI, and Transformer-based language models in particular, now underpin many applications in:\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing** (chatbots, summarization, translation),\n",
    "- **Computer Vision** (via text-conditioned image generation),\n",
    "- **Creative industries** (storytelling, copywriting, code assistants, game dialogue).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the theory and having practical experience with these models is essential for designing responsible and effective generative AI systems.\n"
